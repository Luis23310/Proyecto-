# Proyecto-     

This is the final project for Digital Electronics II, which consists of an automatic sprinkler for plants. with which the MPLAB X program, Proteus and a PIC16F877A were used. It is a self-watering dispenser for plants, which helps the farmer to have an established data on the level of soil moisture and ambient temperature.


## COMPONENTS
For this project I used a 16X2 LCD screen, a humidity sensor, an LM35, a relay module, a motor pump and a humidity sensor.

## INSTALLATION.
The .rar file is downloaded, once it is downloaded, it is unzipped, then in MPLAB click on file and then on open project and the file FLACA 11 is selected, after it is already in MPLAB the folder source files is searched and we give it click on the file MAIN.c


## UTILIZATION.
To use it in Proteus, before doing so, you need to start the code in MPLAB X v4.15 to compile it. Once the previous task has been carried out, proceed to open the project in proteus and double-click, once you see the .cof file, the file is selected. Once selected, the project is started, which presents a small start message on its LCD and if the weather conditions and soil moisture are optimal to start the irrigation with the buttons, the time is set and proceeds to give Start with the Start button.
